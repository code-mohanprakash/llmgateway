# ✅ FIXED: Advanced Routing Now Visible in Navigation

## 🎯 Issue Resolved

**Problem**: The "Advanced Routing" Phase 1 feature was not visible in the navigation bar even though it was implemented.

**Root Cause**: The role comparison was case-sensitive. Your user role is "OWNER" (uppercase) but the code was checking for "owner" (lowercase).

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. **RoleBasedAccess Component** (`/src/components/RoleBasedAccess.js`)
- Fixed case-sensitive role comparisons
- Added `.toLowerCase()` to all role checks
- Now properly handles "OWNER", "ADMIN", "MEMBER" roles

### 2. **Layout Component** (`/src/components/Layout.js`)
- Fixed role badge styling for case-insensitive comparison
- Updated all role icon assignments
- Fixed top-right role display

## 🎉 Result

**Advanced Routing is now visible in the sidebar navigation for OWNER users!**
