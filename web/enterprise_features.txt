# Enterprise Features Implementation Plan
# "Perplexity for API" - Advanced Routing & Cost Optimization

## 🎯 OVERVIEW
This plan implements advanced routing and cost optimization features to position our platform as "Perplexity for API" for AI-first companies. Each phase builds upon the previous one and must be completed, tested, and validated before moving to the next phase.

## 🚨 CRITICAL INSTRUCTION
